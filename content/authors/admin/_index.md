Sam Setta is a postdoctoral research in the Ocean and Molecular Ecology Lab at NOAA PMEL and CICOES UW. She's interested in understanding how changing oceans impact phytoplankton, microscopic photosynthesizers at the base of the food web. She uses molecular techniques (DNA) to identify the presence of species across ocean environments.
